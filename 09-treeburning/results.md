## **RESULTS.MD FINDINGS**
#### Why did you choose the board size for your finalized table?
I chose a board size of 500 for my finalized table because it allowed for a much clearer distinction between results for the burn time in respect with the densities. Especially with smaller sized boards, the numbers are too close with one another, so I knew that a board size of 500 would be able to avoid this problem. Also a board size of 500 is the perfect amount because it ran at a reasonable speed.
#### Why did you choose the number of repetitions size for your finalized table?
I chose to do 100 repetitions because I wanted to be as precise as possible with my results. In class, we talked about initially starting with 100 repetitions, and I found it a perfect number of repetitions in order to make sure my results are good. With a board size of 500, there may be some slight variations when testing the same density, and I wanted to make sure that I would be able to obtain the most precise result in respect with the densities. My code also ran at a reasonable speed with 100 repetitions, in comparison with doing more repetitions.
#### What did your testing show about changing the board size?
My testing displayed that as the board size increased, the burn time and the run time increased. This makes sense because there is much more board space for the fire to spread across. A smaller board size would also have less of a burn time and run time in comparison to a larger board size. Also, increasing the board size brought about a larger difference between the burn times in respect to different densities, especially when looking at a select range such as 5% to 95%.
#### Knowing that there were differences based on board size, what was the relationship between the board size and the maximum burn time? How did you test this?
I knew that there were differences based on the board time, and I was able to figure out that the relationship between the board size and the maximum burn time was that  as the board size increased, the maximum burn time increased. This makes sense because there is much more board space for the fire to spread across. I was able to test this by playing around with the board sizes and checking over all the densities from a specific range. The burn times would change in a respective manner with the board size; a lower board size would generally mean a lower burn time, and a higher board size would generally mean a higher burn time.
#### What density of trees yields the maximum burn time?
The density of trees that I found that yielded the maximum burn time was the 60% ones (0.6 density). That was the maximum value that I noticed in my findings, and the other values that were above/below it had a smaller burn time.
